                <p>The life of a worker in the vineyard of God is the life of one who is selfless; full of love and the
                fear of
                God. The life of a worker does not belong to himself but rather to Christ <ins>(Gal. 2:20)</ins> as
                    Christ
                    is the sole runner of the life.
                    The worker then is entitled more with doing the Father's business rather than his affairs.</p>
                <p>The life of a worker in the vineyard entails one <strong>dying to self and being alive in Christ
                        Jesus</strong>; it entails one allowing the will of God to consume his own will so that he does
                    the
                    Father's desires.</p>
                <p>The vineyard worker can be likened to a soldier in service who has the obligation of obeying his
                    commander,
                    he does not take or handle the things of the master just like mere civilians, the vineyard worker in
                    like
                    manner must not mingle with the affairs of this world if he is to diligently serve his master(2
                    Timothy2:4
                    ).</p>
                <p>The vineyard worker as a song minister; the music minister who is also a soldier of Christ does not
                    sing
                    to
                    receive praises from his congregation, he has the duty of ministering in songs to bring down the
                    glory
                    and
                    presence of God to heal, save, e.t.c (1 Sam 16:14-23)which implies that frequent, fervent and
                    intentional
                    tarrying in God's presence is very important.</p>
                <p>The vineyard worker is also an evangelist (Prov 11:30); in every way and means by which he can
                    proclaim
                    the
                    love of God and the grace of God that brings salvation(Titus 2:11), he should do it knowing that the
                    vineyard workers do not work with the times and seasons of this as the Son of Man would come to take
                    his
                    children into his glory at anytime which is unknown(Jn 9:4).</p>
