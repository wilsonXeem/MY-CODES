            <p>The life of a worker in the vineyard of God is the life of one who is selfless; full of love and the
                fear of
                God. The life of a worker does not belong to himself but rather to Christ <ins>(Gal. 2:20)</ins> as
                Christ
                is the sole runner of the life.
                The worker then is entitled more with doing the Father's business rather than his affairs.</p>
            <p>The life of a worker in the vineyard entails one <strong>dying to self and being alive in Christ
                    Jesus</strong>; it entails one allowing the will of God to consume his own will so that he does
                the
                Father's desires.</p>
            <p>The vineyard worker can be likened to a soldier in service who has the obligation of obeying his
                commander,
                he does not take or handle the things of the master just like mere civilians, the vineyard worker in
                like
                manner must not mingle with the affairs of this world if he is to diligently serve his master(2
                Timothy2:4
                ).</p>
            <p>The vineyard worker as a song minister; the music minister who is also a soldier of Christ does not
                sing
                to
                receive praises from his congregation, he has the duty of ministering in songs to bring down the
                glory
                and
                presence of God to heal, save, e.t.c (1 Sam 16:14-23)which implies that frequent, fervent and
                intentional
                tarrying in God's presence is very important.</p>
            <p>The vineyard worker is also an evangelist (Prov 11:30); in every way and means by which he can
                proclaim
                the
                love of God and the grace of God that brings salvation(Titus 2:11), he should do it knowing that the
                vineyard workers do not work with the times and seasons of this as the Son of Man would come to take
                his
                children into his glory at anytime which is unknown(Jn 9:4).</p>
